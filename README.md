## About This Repository

This repository contains the Kotlin code used to build [iTwin.js](http://www.itwinjs.org) applications on Android devices. This package requires Android API Level 28 (Android 9.0) or later.

## Note
This package is designed to be used with the [@itwin/mobile-sdk-core](https://github.com/iTwin/mobile-sdk-core) and [@itwin/mobile-ui-react](https://github.com/iTwin/mobile-ui-react) packages. Those two packages are intended to be installed via npm, and their version number must match the version number of this package. Furthermore, they use __iTwin.js 3.3.5__, and your app must use that same version of iTwin.js.
